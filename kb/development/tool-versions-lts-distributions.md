## Open-source tools in popular long-term support distributions

Mbed TLS' minimum tool version requirements are usually set based on the versions shipped in long-term support releases of major operating systems. The table below lists versions of relevant software in distributions that are in support.

[RHEL](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata#Life_Cycle_Dates) 6 is on extended lifecycle support until June 2024. The list of packages is identical to [CentOS 6](http://vault.centos.org/6.10/os/Source/SPackages/), and in RHEL 7 to [CentOS 7](http://vault.centos.org/7.8.2003/os/Source/SPackages/).

Ubuntu 16.04 is on extended security maintenance (ESM) until April 2024. Debian long-time support lasts less long, so the oldest versions of software that are supported in a Debian release are slightly less old than for Ubuntu, therefore we don't need to look at Debian versions.

[pkgs.org](https://pkgs.org/) indexes the software versions in many currently-supported distributions. This includes Ubuntu LTS and CentOS, but not RHEL ELS.
