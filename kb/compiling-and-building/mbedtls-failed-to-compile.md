# Mbed TLS failed to compile on XXXX

This can happen. We cannot anticipate all interactions between software version and platforms.

We have an ever-expanding set of hardware and OS platforms on which Mbed TLS is automatically built. Please [open a discussion or file a ticket on Github](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls/issues), or [contact us directly](https://tls.mbed.org/contact).

Please provide us with as much information as possible on:

* The compilation error you encounter.
* The compiler (type and version) you use.
* The chipset of your system.
* The operating system you use.
