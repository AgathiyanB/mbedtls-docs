# Copyright and contributions

## Can I contribute?

Yes, you can! We welcome all contributions that improve Mbed TLS. This can range from bug fixes, typo fixes and better platform support to new features and modules.

It may be wise to [contact us](/contact) beforehand if you intend to contribute a larger feature. We might already be working on it internally and we don't like telling you: "*Ok. Thanks. But........ We already did it ourselves.*"
