# What is the export control status of Mbed TLS?

Mbed TLS, as supplied in the open source repository, is considered open source
and publicly available for purposes of the U.S. Export Administration
Regulations (EAR) and as such, is not subject to the EAR.

Your usage of, or any modifications or changes you make to, Mbed TLS may affect
the export control status of Mbed TLS under the EAR and any other applicable
export control regimes. As noted on the
[U.S. BIS website](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/policy-guidance/encryption/1-encryption-items-not-subject-to-the-ear):

>   While open source code itself may be publicly available and not subject to
    the EAR, an item is not considered publicly available merely because it
    incorporates or calls to publicly available open source code. Rather, a new
    item with encryption functionality has been created which would need to be
    evaluated as a whole under the EAR.

The information provided here is intended to assist you with your determination
of the applicable export compliance requirements and does not, and is not
intended to, constitute legal advice. It remains your responsibility to comply
with applicable export controls and sanctions regimes, and to consult
applicable government authorities and/or counsel as needed.
