# FTP folder for automatic downloads

When automatically checking for newer versions of Arm Mbed TLS, it is helpful to have an FTP-like folder of HTTP-indices for automatic downloads, rather than a website to parse.

We have two endpoints that provide you with more direct access:

## Current downloads

See the [list of the current versions of the stable branches of Mbed TLS](https://tls.mbed.org/download-archive).

## Download archive

See the [full archive of all versions of Mbed TLS](https://tls.mbed.org/code/releases).
